# Tea Party

Tea Party is a simple visual novel game made for research into how non-sequential dialogues may affect the player experience in some scenarios. It uses [Unity asynchronous Dialogue System](https://github.com/Celezt/UnityAsyncDialogueSystem).

## Classic and Interruption

The game has two versions that the player can choose from inside the menu: classic or interruption. The classic is the traditional turned-based dialogue that waits on the player's input before proceeding. The interruption version, on the other hand, is in real-time, which requires the player to respond in time or not to respond. The game is fully playable without answering once.

Both versions have different endings, and your actions (or lack of) decide what ending you will experience.

## Prologue

The game is visually inspired by the game Undertale. In this game, the player has been invited to a tea party high up and far away from civilization. The host — Lady Madam — is a candidate to become the future monarch of the kingdom with the desire to convince the player to support her during the coming royal election. On her right side stands Charles the Bug Butler — who has been her loyal butler for many years and many more to come. Their relationship is complex or right-out abusive for Charles; this does not mean Lady Madam does not care about Charles — she is just imprudent.
